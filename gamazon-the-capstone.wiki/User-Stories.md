# 1. Users Authentication

## Sign Up

* As an unregistered and unauthorized user, I want to be able to sign up for the website via a sign-up form.
  * When I'm on the `/signup` page:
    * I would like to be able to enter my email, username, and preferred password on a clearly laid out form.
    * I would like the website to log me in upon successful completion of the sign-up form.
      * So that I can seamlessly access the site's functionality
  * When I enter invalid data on the sign-up form:
    * I would like the website to inform me of the validations I failed to pass, and repopulate the form with my valid entries (except my password).
    * So that I can try again without needing to refill forms I entered valid data into.

## Log in

* As a registered and unauthorized user, I want to be able to log in to the website via a log-in form.
  * When I'm on the `/login` page:
    * I would like to be able to enter my email and password on a clearly laid out form.
    * I would like the website to log me in upon successful completion of the lob-up form.
      * So that I can seamlessly access the site's functionality
  * When I enter invalid data on the log-up form:
    * I would like the website to inform me of the validations I failed to pass, and repopulate the form with my valid entries (except my password).
      * So that I can try again without needing to refill forms I entered valid data into.

## Demo User

* As an unregistered and unauthorized user, I would like an easy-to-find and clear button on both the `/signup` and `/login` pages to allow me to visit the site as a guest without signing up or logging in.
  * When I'm on either the `/signup` or `/login` pages:
    * I can click on a Demo User button to log me in and allow me access as a normal user.
      * So that I can test the site's features and functionality without entering credentials.

## Log Out

* As a logged-in user, I want to log out via an easy-to-find log-out button on the navigation bar.
  * While on any page of the site:
    * I can log out of my account and be redirected to a page displaying recent FauxTweets.
      * So that I can easily log out to keep my information secure.
